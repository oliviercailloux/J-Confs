= Our answer to the cloud needed


The purpose of this document is to document the storage functionality of online conferences.


A graphical user interface called "GuiListConferences" has been set up with the aim of displaying, editing and adding conferences to an online calendar storage website by the last team.


The calendar storage website used is called fruux. It is a free service that allows you to keep your contacts and calendars synchronized on many platforms.


In order to be able to exchange data between the application and fruux, it is necessary to use an online calendar editing protocol named *CalDav*.


The CalDav4j library has been chosen in order to allow these exchanges, it includes a set of methods allowing the edition of events and the addition of new events online. All the methods using this library are in the "CalendarOnline" class.



== Prerequisites in v1:

	* A fruux account.
	* The calendar must be in ICalendar format. It contains a set of events represented by "VEvent" components, which must be named according to the naming standards.
- The "UID" property contains a unique identifier of an event.
- The "description" property contains the value of the conference fee.
- The "location" property contains the name of the city followed by the name of the country (fields separated by a comma) of the conference.
- The "summary" property contains the title of the event.

	* Within the Java code it is necessary to indicate a set of information to be retrieved on fruux. This information will allow you to have the authorization to retrieve events from a desired calendar. It is necessary to have :
- The calendar identification key on fruux.
- The user id on fruux.
- The user password on fruux.

== Prerequisites in v2:


We heard that some researchers would like to use another cloud solution different from Fruux. 
Example :

- NextCloud
- OwnCloud

Those solutions have a CalDav API. So what we have to do is to change the constructor of CalendarOnline. We need to create a class which manage CalDav protocol and give information to CalendarOnline.

Here you can find a class diagram :

You also have the use case diagram :

We may use a GUI to fulfill the information.
