The package calendar permits to use an online calendar or to use a local file file calendar with limited options. To use an online calendar you need first, to set credential providers in order to connect to the calendar. After that, you can add, edit, delete, and get online conferences.
By connecting with a local calendar you can only create a conference.

This use case is a detailed version of the general use case about one or several specific use cases. It details the following use cases:

* https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/blob/master/Doc/UML%20documentation/General_View.adoc#use-case-diagram[Manage online calendar] 

* https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/blob/master/Doc/UML%20documentation/General_View.adoc#use-case-diagram[Visualize conferences in an online calendar]

This diagram is accessible from the general view use case via a hyperlink (click on the use case).

In this package that is represented in Papyrus, we have 4 classes : CalendarOnline, CalendarConnector, UserCredentials and ReadCalendarFiles.

* CalendarOnline manage a calendar. 
* CalendarConnector connect to the calendar. 
* UserCredentials read a file and give credential to CalendarConnector.

We can see how the CalendarConnector as connector is important in order to add a conference.

Here you can find how we look for online conferences. The main update will be on ConferenceReader and how it is managing the vEvent that we give to him. For now, it is mandatory to have all the field present in Conference but we will solved that in IT3 with the ConferenceBuilder.

=== IT3 Java

We will implement the UserCredential class that will catch information from a JSON file which is at the path. We will change also the way getOnlineConferences in CalendarOnline works in order to avoid exception raised if an event catch don't have any URL for example. We will raise exception if one of the four mandatory field is missing for a conference that is to say : a uid, a title, a start date and an end date. 

=== What could be done next

We will implement the UserCredential class that will catch information from a JSON file which is at the path.
This sequence diagram explain to us how a CalendarConnector is initiate. We have CalendarOnline which has a CalendarConnector as field so we decided to add it as it is the main client of the CalendarConnector. We can see how we use the ical4j API and a new way to retrieve credential. 

We want to add a function send to git and a function restore from git in CalendarOnline. We also need to add a function that help us to know if the calendar is writeable/readable. We have to add mergeCalendar, a function that merge all calendars online.
Another thing that has been added is the possibility to read from classpath and a connector that help the user to connect to calendar.
