= Location package
:toc: 
:sectanchors:

This package use https://locationiq.com/[LocationIQ API] and contains four classes. 

Let's look at some diagrams about the classes of the package.

This use case is a detailed version of the general use case about one or several specific use cases. It details the following use case:

* With the class AddressQuerier you can get informations such as latitude, longitude and more detailled informations simply by enter an literal address (precise or not).
* With the class DistanceDuration you can calculate the distance and the duration beetween two addresses and also get all the itinerary steps beetween them.
* With the class Address you can store an address as a specific object define by his latitude, longitude and an (optional) string address. 
* With the class Step you can store a step define as a departureAddress and a arrivalAddress (of Address class). It's also possible to add the distance and duration informations of a step.

=== More details about the classes
==== AddressQuerier
This class use the geocoding part of the api LocationIQ (https://locationiq.com/docs-html/index.html#search-forward-geocoding[see doc here])

Function *requestAddressInformations* takes an address as a parameter (precise or not). It makes it possible to retrieve several pieces of information on several different addresses which can be the address sought. The information is stored in an *addressInformations* List that is an attribute on this class.

Then the *getLastAddressFound function* allows you to find only the addresses in the *addressInformations* List. These addresses are then stored in the *attribute addressFound* in the format *Address*.

The *connexion* function allows you to initialize and configure an *ApiClient* using our key. 

The AddressQuerier object allows you to request the locationIQ API to find different addresses. Once the object is initialized, the connection to the API is set up and from this object several requests can be sent to research an address.


==== DistanceDuration
This class use the directions part of the api LocationIQ (https://locationiq.com/docs-html/index.html#directions[see doc here]) 

The constructor of this class takes two addresses (of type Address) as parameters in order to get latitude and longitude corresponding to this addresses. 

The private method *calculateDistanceDuration* is used to connect to the API in order to get the distance, duration and all the traject informations (trip attribute).

== Sequence diagram

For this sequence diagram we have chosen to represent the interaction "address: String" by an arrow which loops over AddressQuerier. We made this choice because in the GUI we have not yet implemented the function which asks the user to enter the address he wishes to search.

== Problems encountered
- Unfortunatly the API wasn't available on maven central, so we imported all the https://github.com/location-iq/locationiq-java-client[source code] at the root of the project (src/main/java/com.locationiq.client). Duplicate classes coming from the client code generator use by the developpers of the github depository have been delete.
- Something important to be notice, using a free acount for the api limit the rate of requests per second, this is why we put a few `TimeUnit.SECONDS.sleep(1);` in the code.


== What could be done next

It might be interesting next to display the itinerary on a map. LocationIQ provide interesting stuff about it (https://locationiq.com/docs-html/index.html#static-maps[see doc here]). The static maps API return an image in response of an HTTP request. The `path` parameter of the HTTP request defines one or more paths to draw on the map separated by pipe characters. The path are defines by latitude and longitude (`path=lat1,lon1|lat2,lon2|`). We havn't got the time to test it but using `DistanceDuration.getAllSteps()` you might be able to easily draw the map itinerary.
