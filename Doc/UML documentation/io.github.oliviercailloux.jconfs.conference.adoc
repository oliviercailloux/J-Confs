This package groups together classes allowing to manage conferences as its name indicates. 
Indeed it contains the classes allowing to create conferences. 
For example : 

* The conferenceReader class for example which reads information from a calendar file and creates a conference object.
* The conference class defines what a conference is with its attributes and constructor.
* The Retriever interface reads conference data and return a set of conferences.
* The conferenceShower class show Conferences data.
* The conferenceWriter class Delete the conference of the ics file (if it exists), Add the conference in the ics file file (if it exists) and Save the given conference in the ics File. 
* The invalidConferenceFormatException class custom exception use for a conference creation.


=== What we plan to do 

In the Conference packages, there are some changes to be made to improve the code, make it "cleaner", improve functions or remove unnecessary things.
There are for example : 

* Delete the conferencesRetriever class which allows to generate a conference list from entered data. But we could, instead of dedicating a whole class to this part, simply implement it in another class.
* Complexify the recording of a price. Indeed, we would like to complicate the registrationFee attribute which concerns the management of prices. We will have to make this attribute take into account as a parameter a researcher who will return a price depending on the status of the person who reserves and the reservation period.
