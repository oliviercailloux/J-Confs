This diagram corresponds to the somewhat simplified use of the application. The purpose of the application is to allow the user (researcher, user of the administration) to create a conference. So he can look for a researcher and assign him a conference. It can then generate a mission order for a researcher or a young researcher. The user can also visualize all conferences in an online calendar. Furthermore, he can delete or edit conferences.

In this diagram we have added hyper links on each use case. These hyper links allow you to click on a use case. This click will take you to another more detailed use case. The links are also visible by using the general use cases in the specific use cases.

Here are all the links between general view use case and others:

* Manage online conference --> https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/blob/master/Doc/UML%20documentation/Calendar.adoc#use-case-diagram[Calendar use case]

* Manage conference --> https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/blob/master/Doc/UML%20documentation/Conference.adoc#use-case-diagram[Conference use case]

* Search a researcher --> https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/blob/master/Doc/UML%20documentation/Gui.adoc#use-case-diagram[GUI use case]

* Create a researcher --> https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/blob/master/Doc/UML%20documentation/Researcher.adoc#use-case-diagram[Researcher use case]

* Generate a document with informations about a conference --> https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/blob/master/Doc/UML%20documentation/Document.adoc#use-case-diagram[Document use case]

* Generate a map with the place of a conference --> https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/blob/master/Doc/UML%20documentation/Map.adoc#use-case-diagram[Map use case]

* Visualize conferences in an online calendar --> https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/blob/master/Doc/UML%20documentation/Calendar.adoc#use-case-diagram[Calendar use case]

* Generate location for conference --> https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/blob/master/Doc/UML%20documentation/Location.adoc#use-case-diagram[Location use case]

We plan to add a feature to show the route (optimized) between his location and the location of the conference.

=== Package diagram

Here you have a package diagram where we can see package dependencies. As usual, the package which is the most dependent is the GUI one.
