HOW TO STORE A CONFERENCE

To store a conference, we use the eponymous class. In order to create a new event, we call the class ConferenceBuilder, which belongs to the class Conference. The created object is a composure of 8 different fields. Six of its are mandatory and 2 are optional.

The 6 mandatory fields are:
1.	The id of the conference: this piece of data is automatically generated during the earliest stage of the inception.
2.	The title of the conference
3.	The host city of the conference
4.	The country in which the city is located
Those four fields are String object.
5.	The date of the start of the conference
6.	And obviously, the date of the end of the event
Bullets 2 to 5 are compulsory, since they give the most basic information about any conference.

The 2 optional fields are:
7.	The url of the conference
8.	The registration fee of it

Both are Optional object. The url has a String as variable argument and the registration fee has a Integer variable argument.
Since conferences donâ€™t always have a dedicated website, the url field is optional. Moreover, a conference can be free. Therefore, the registration fee is not always necessary.

An object of the class conference is considered as an actual conference only when the title, the beginning date and the end date are registered.

A hash code can also be extracted from any object of the class.

We can access every field of a created object thanks to get functions. A toString() function provides a way to get every information while using only one call to a function.
