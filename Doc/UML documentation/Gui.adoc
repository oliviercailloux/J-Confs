This use case is a detailed version of the general use case about one or several specific use cases. It details the following use case:

* Search a researcher

This diagram is accessible from the general view use case via a hyperlink (click on the use case).

The GUI package allows you to set up a home machine interface and simplify the use of the application.
This package allows the user to set up an interface containing widgets that allow them to perform several actions described for the most part in other use case diagrams. 

The application is currently able to display a window by using *Guiconference class* that allow you to perform different actions such as:

* search a researcher from dauphine online phone book
* create a conference 
* Display a list of conferences
* Display a map of conference location
* Generate LibreOffice document

=== What could be done next

Actually one action can work (search a researcher), the others can be improved in order to become operational, for this you can use an *MVC* architecture (Model-View-Controller) to associate events and methods, for example to:

 *  Display a map of conference location
 ** Use the functionality of class *MapGUI* like a View
 ** Use class *DistanceDuration* of package *Location* that allow you to generate a list of steps between two adresses and use an API like http://www.openstreetmap.fr/[OpenStreetMap^] to make a Model
 ** Ameliorate ListenerAction to create a Controller
 
 * Edit/Search a conference
 ** By using some functionality of package https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/blob/master/Doc/UML%20documentation/Conference.adoc[Conference^]. <=See the doc here, you can create a Model to recover online a conference 
 ** Create a GUI specialized to see all informations about a conference that allow to make changes or search another conference with a button Search for exemple ( View )
 ** Create a ListenerAction to associate the methodes like *searchConferenceByTitle* present in class *ConferencesShower* of package *Conference* to a event when a button(Search) on you GUI is clicked
