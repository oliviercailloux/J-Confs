This package mainly deals with the management of mission orders.
For example: 
* The generateOM class fills a searcher Mission Order.
* The generateOMYS class fills a searcher Mission Order but for a young searcher.
* The MissionOrder class generate a spreed sheet document about a mission order.


=== What we plan to do 

In the package document, there is also some modifications to do to improve the code. For example : 

* Investigate the existence of a more modern API for manipulating OpenDocument documents. We are therefore studying the different existing solutions in order to choose the one that would best suit our project.
* Set up the generation and storage of the Mission Order (OM) or JC request. If one already exists, it goes into the history. We could add a JC class and put generate and store functions in it and possibly add attriubuts. We would have to add a store function in generateOM and generateOMYS. We're also thinking about storing everything on git.
* Extract a specialized program dealing with LibreOffice document generation and create its own GitHub repository. To do so, you would have to create a new class containing this program. I've already created a github repository and let's think about it.
