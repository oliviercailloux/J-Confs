J-Confs
-------
For the next iteration of java we plan to work on the following tasks :

. Use Instant in Conference. Use double instead of Doubles. Use a Builder.

. Delete the package io.github.oliviercailloux.geocode and start integration of LocationIQ API following available documentation.

. Ensure that CalendarOnline stores conferences in a format that is understood by calendar manipulation software such as Evolution. Write a report in Asciidoctor format indicating which fields of the iCal standard should be used, in particular, how to represent a specific point on the globe (latitude, longitude, text address).

*These tasks are independent.*
