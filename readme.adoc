* Majid : I participate to Pr https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/5[#5], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/24[#24], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/30[#30], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/40[#40] and https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/43[#43]. First we modified the code in order that we can connect to NextCloud. This makes me created JUnit task to make us able to know when we can reach a server Nextcloud. We tried to simplify our pom.xml. This was difficult because it wasn't usual yet for us to work on pom which seems to not have an error. The fact that now Github give us a good status make me hope that this will be the last time that something like that will appear. Unfortunately, I was too ambitious in the PR #30 and make it before PR#40. In my mind, we could work on those topics separately but it wasn't the case because Calendar and Conference are linked. So we need to make one PR approved to move on another topic. So we try something which is detailed as proposal in Calendar but it hasn't been merged with master. Sometimes I need some time to avoid using try catch. This project help me on that. I participate to the builder of conference and make stronger our test that we have set up in the first PR. They were some issue that we find after like when you create an event with the same uid and some event wasn't readable.

* Sébastien BOURG : I participate to PR https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/5[#5], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/24[#24], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/35[#35], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/36[#36], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/39[#39]. This includes tasks about http connection (in calendar for Nextcloud and fruux and also with locationiq api), CALDAV and VEVENT manipulation (also in calendar), parsing of an http answer (in DistanceDuration class), imuability of classes (for Address and Step classes), J-Unit testing for different type of classes (DistanceDuration and CalendarOnline). All of those tasks were a good discover of oriented-object programming and continuous integration.
I've got, at the beginning of the project, difficulties to understand how git was working. Especially about the fact that git only looks at changes made during commits and not comparing every file of the project (for merging). It wasn't easy to integrate all the source code of LocationIq API because it wasn't on maven central and the github repository wasn't clear about the double generate classes.
