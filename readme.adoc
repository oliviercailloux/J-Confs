* Improve conference and calendar package (PR #30 #40)

Team 2 :

* Do last change for the PR #39

== Rapport

* Majid ACHRIA : I participate to Pr https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/5[#5], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/24[#24], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/30[#30], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/40[#40] and https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/43[#43]. First we modified the code in order that we can connect to NextCloud. This makes me created JUnit task to make us able to know when we can reach a server Nextcloud. We tried to simplify our pom.xml. This was difficult because it wasn't usual yet for us to work on pom which seems to not have an error. The fact that now Github give us a good status make me hope that this will be the last time that something like that will appear. Unfortunately, I was too ambitious in the PR #30 and make it before PR#40. In my mind, we could work on those topics separately but it wasn't the case because Calendar and Conference are linked. So we need to make one PR approved to move on another topic. So we try something which is detailed as proposal in Calendar but it hasn't been merged with master. Sometimes I need some time to avoid using try catch. This project help me on that. I participate to the builder of conference and make stronger our test that we have set up in the first PR. They were some issue that we find after like when you create an event with the same uid and some event wasn't readable.

* Sébastien BOURG : I participate to PR https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/5[#5], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/24[#24], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/35[#35], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/36[#36], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/39[#39]. This includes tasks about http connection (in calendar for Nextcloud and fruux and also with locationiq api), CALDAV and VEVENT manipulation (also in calendar), parsing of an http answer (in DistanceDuration class), imuability of classes (for Address and Step classes), J-Unit testing for different type of classes (DistanceDuration and CalendarOnline). All of those tasks were a good discover of oriented-object programming and continuous integration. 
I've got, at the beginning of the project, difficulties to understand how git was working. Especially about the fact that git only looks at changes made during commits and not comparing every file of the project (for merging). It wasn't easy to integrate all the source code of LocationIq API because it wasn't on maven central and the github repository wasn't clear about the double generate classes. 

* Anis ZOUARI : I participate to PR https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/24[#24], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/30[#30], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/40[#40] and https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/39[#39]. 
The first modifications made were to be able to connect to NextCloud.
I particularly worked on conference and calendar packages for two iterations in a row. Which implies that these are the packages that I know the best. I had the opportunity to improve what the previous developers had already implemented. I also could set up J-Unit tests for some classes, which allowed me on the one hand to check that they worked well and on the other hand, it gave me ideas of better implementations.	
The main difficulty was during the first iteration, I had the role of PO. We did not quite understand what its role was precisely, what earned me a management of this iteration which is to be reviewed, but if it was to be repeated a second time I think I am doing much better.

* Floryan KIEFFER : I participate to PR https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/8[#8] ,https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/13[#13], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/24[#24], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/35[#35], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/36[#36], https://github.com/sebastienbourg/J-Confs/pull/39[#39]. During this project, I participated exclusively in the implementation of the rental package. I first participated in the research of the API that we used to replace the geocode package. We chose the locationiq API. I participated in the implementation of this API in the project with the manual importation of the rentaliq packages and the recovery of the dependencies contained in the pom.xml of this API in the pom of our project. As for the location package, I actively participated in the implementation of all the classes (including the test classes) but more particularly the AddressQuerier and Address classes. I implemented the AddressQuerier class with advice from my classmates. Following the numerous request changes submitted by Mr. Cailloux, the AddressQuerier class did not stop evolving during the entire project until June 28 when PR 39 was accepted. I also implemented the addition of the JSON dependency to be able to replace the default connection of the PR 39 with a personalized connection by reading a JSON file (Configuration.JSON) in which the connection information is stored. Finally, I opened issue # 45 because the classes in the location package are not yet perfect.
